## Product Description

The FCK Trend Indicator is a trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It utilizes a specified period and threshold value to generate trading signals based on the trend direction.

This indicator can be used to identify potential buying or selling opportunities in the financial markets. It calculates the moving average of the close prices over a specified period and compares it to the current close price. If the close price is above the moving average plus the threshold, a buy signal is generated. If the close price is below the moving average minus the threshold, a sell signal is generated. Otherwise, no trading signal is generated.
